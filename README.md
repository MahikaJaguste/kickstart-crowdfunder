This is a multi-page Nextjs app that allows users to view various ongoing campaigns and contribute ethers to them.
Tthe campaign owner can raise a request describing how much money he wants to spend on which vendor and the contributors can vote if the request seems genuine.
The Solidity smart contract maintains the list of contributors and the amount contributed.
It also maintains a list of requests and automatically transfers the required money to the campaign owner once a request gets approved, giving power to the contributors
This project was done as a part of the Udemy course- Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developerâ€™s Guide
